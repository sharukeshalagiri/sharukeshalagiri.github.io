# 🌐 Sharukesh Alagiri — Personal Website

Hey there 👋  
This is the source for my personal site — [**sharukesh.com**](https://sharukesh.com).  
It’s where I showcase my work, projects, and a bit of my journey as a Computer Science & Engineering student at **MIT – Anna University**.

# 🚀 About
This website is hosted using **GitHub Pages** directly from this repository:  
[`sharukeshalagiri.github.io`](https://github.com/sharukeshalagiri/sharukeshalagiri.github.io)

My custom domain [**sharukesh.com**](https://sharukesh.com) points here,  
so any changes I push are deployed live instantly — no extra steps, no downtime.

GitHub Pages site (sharukeshalagiri.github.io) is actually hosting the content.
The custom domain (sharukesh.com) is just pointing to that GitHub Pages site via DNS (usually using a CNAME record).
